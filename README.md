# 05-Challenge

## Challenges # 1
Arrays can store many different answers for a program. We can pick one of these answers at random using a random number generator. This is good for games that need random answers.

Make a Magic 8 Ball game. It will ask you a question, then gives you an answer like "Yes", "No", "Maybe" or "Ask again later"

Example Output

```
What's your question?  Will I pass my upcoming exam? Ask again later.
Ask again later.
```


## Challenges # 2
Create a program that takes a number from 1 to 12 and converts it to the corresponding month of the year. Upon execution, the program will prompt the user to enter a number representing a month and output the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December. If an invalid number is entered, an error message should be displayed.

### Example Output
```
Please enter the number of the month: 3
The name of the month is March.
```
